Course Expectations


Contacting Me

The best way to contact me is by e-mail.  I will do my best to answer your e-mails within 24 hours or as soon as possible. Additionally, make note of your name, class, and section when you are emailing.  


Live Chat Sessions 

The live chat sessions are a dynamic function used at CTU Online, but they are not mandatory.  If you cannot attend the live chats, I still encourage you to experience them on the archives.  My Chat Sessions will include a presentation from me about upcoming topics that we will cover in class, discussion time, and a brief overview of upcoming tasks.  The discussion time includes you to get involved in question/answer sessions as well- so itâ€™s interactive!



Submitting Assignments

In the course apart from the first discussion board you will submit your work through the Intellipath system.  Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are key elements in the English language and should not be overlooked when posting to the discussion board.   

  

Discussion Board

The Discussion Board is a forum for you to share your findings and point of view on the task topics with your classmates.  Any personal attacks, though, will be deleted. This also will result in a zero on that assignment. Please be civil in your discussions. If you have questions, e-mail me.  To avoid confusion, when responding to another classmate's post in/on the discussion board, please address her or his name in the beginning of your response.  Attach files to the Discussion Board and also copy and paste from a Word document to the board.


Good Luck!

As mentioned elsewhere, I want this to not only be a knowledgeable experience for all of you- but also one that you find interesting and engaging.  Learning should not be looked upon as a chore- but as a method of expression.  I urge each of you to keep your goals in mind when participating in class.  Believe it or not- what you learn now will pay off in your future.
